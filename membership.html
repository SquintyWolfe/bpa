<h2>
How is BPA Organized?
</h2>
Each BPA Charter State has its own governing body and a State Advisor who directs State programs and conferences. National Business Professionals of America is built from the partnership of these State organizations working together. The national organization benefits members by producing the Workplace Skills Assessment Program, national conferences, national programs, and representing/uniting the organization. Each BPA chapter (unless it's an independent chapter) is part of a State BPA organization as well the national BPA organization.
<br  />
BPA further organizes its members into membership classifications:
<br  />
<li><strong>College / Post-secondary Division:</strong> For post-secondary (one-year, two-year, baccalaureate, or post-baccalaureate) students enrolled or formerly enrolled in initial, refresher, or upgrading business, career technical, business education and career or related education programs.</li>
<li><strong>High School / Secondary Division:</strong> For high school students enrolled or formerly enrolled in initial, refresher, or upgrading business, career technical, and career or related education programs. Associate Member Designation is for high school students enrolled or formerly enrolled in initial, refresher, or upgrading business, career technical, and career or related education programs for special populations.</li>
<li><strong>Middle Level Division:</strong> For middle school students enrolled or formerly enrolled in initial, refresher, or upgrading business, career technical, and career or related education programs.</li>
<li><strong>Alumni Division:</strong> For former active members of any student division</li>
<li><strong>Professional Membership:</strong> A professional member may be a person associated with BPA. (Such members may include teachers, teacher-coordinators, teacher-educators and supervisors, employers and/or training station sponsors of business education, friends of Business Professionals of America, corporate sponsors, and others appointed by the governing educational body willing to contribute to Business Professionals of America's growth and development). Professional members are stand-alone members, not serving as part of a chartered division.</li>
